# 2–5 (Optimization & Classification)

This repo contains my solutions for Problems 2–5 of the homework:

- **2** – Gradient descent on a 1D function, including step-size comparison.
- **3** – Linear regression with two features using the normal equation, plus 3D visualization.
- **4** – Logistic regression on a 2D toy dataset with learning-rate tuning and decision boundary plots.
- **5** – Cat vs. non-cat image classification using a fine-tuned ResNet18:
  - 5.1: Original train/test split.
  - 5.2: Modified split from the original training set only.
